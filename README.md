# üí± Currency Exchange & Discount Calculation API

A Spring Boot 3.4.3 microservice that calculates the **net payable amount** for a customer‚Äôs bill by applying **dynamic discounts** and **real-time currency conversion**. It integrates with a third-party currency exchange API and follows modern software development practices, including secure, scalable, and maintainable code design.

    - JWT/Basic Authentication (configurable)

- **Modern Software Practices**
    - Object-oriented design and Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
    - Implemented based on SOLID principles
    - Strategy Design Pattern - Behaviour Design Pattern
    - Unit and integration tests with high coverage (JUnit 5 & Mockito)
    - Static code analysis using SonarQube

### üìù Assumptions & Design Decisions

Discounts are mutually exclusive; the highest applies.

Customers over 2 years get loyalty discounts

Percentage discounts do not apply to grocery items.

Currency exchange rates are cached to reduce API calls.

Resilience4j used for Circuit Breaker and Retry in external API calls.

Authentication defaults to Basic Auth, but JWT can be enabled if needed.
